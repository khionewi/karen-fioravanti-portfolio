            <p>Hi, I'm Karen also known as Khionewi! I'm a web developer, artist, author and scientist. I love to learn new things and create beautiful works be it of art or a website.  </p>
<br>
<br>
            <p>Artist and Author, <a href="https://a.co/d/irsXtuo">Khionewi Rivers,</a> I creates worlds both visually and in writing that fit her cute and quirky personality. I am an artist and author that embraces the cute and quirky sides of me.  Whether it be painting or writing, there is a reflection of me in all that I do. </p>
<br>
<br>
            <p>I specialize in watercolors, oils, and pen/ink.</p>
   <br> 
   <br>            
            <p>When I write it tends to be short stories or poems. I am influenced by H.P. Lovecraft and Eager Allen Poe.</p>
  <br>
  <br>              
            <p>I live with my family where the snow flies.  We make our home with five bunnies.</p>
